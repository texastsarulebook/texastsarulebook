# Texas TSA Rulebook Introduction

The Texas Technology Student Association (TSA) State Competition is managed and conducted by the Texas TSA Board of Directors and Texas TSA State Contest Director, under the oversight of the Texas Education Agency (TEA) and its policies regarding CTSOs. The state competition includes: a business meeting, state officer elections, project competition and student competitive events.

All interested Technology Education students in Texas are invited to attend this annual meeting. The specific time and place of events and contest details will be distributed by the Contest Director.

The cost of transporting and insuring the projects to and from the competition is the responsibility of the school, teachers, and student. Texas TSA will not be responsible for damage, loss, or theft before, during, or after the competition. Texas TSA will not be responsible for mailing or shipping of any projects or awards. Chapters will be solely responsible for picking up projects and awards at the end of the State Contest. Anything left after contest will be thrown away by the Fort Worth Convention Center within 1 hour after the closing of the last general session.

The competition is restricted to the activities and classifications described in this publication. The competition does not attempt to provide a classification for additional activities that might be conducted in the Technology Education programs or other school programs. Only those students and advisors who are registered members of the Texas Technology Student Association (TSA) are on the regular mailing list.
