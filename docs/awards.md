## Purchasing Awards

One award per event placing is provided by Texas TSA. Awards are distributed after the Awards Ceremony which is during the Third General Session. Chapters that do not pick up their earned awards will forfeit their awards. Earned awards will not be mailed to Chapters. Additional awards may be purchased by the advisor, with two options available as described below

### Option A - OnSite

Chapters can purchase additional awards on-site. Accepted forms of payment are PayPal, cash, or check.

### Option B - By Mail

Chapters can purchase awards up to 10 calendar days after the end of the State Contest by completing a form that will be available at the awards desk after the Third General Session. Chapters wishing to purchase additional awards after State Contest will be required to pay the postage cost to mail the awards via USPS Priority Mail. Advisors may pay with a PO, PayPal, cash or check.
First Place for all NQE Events and UTE OnSite Events will receive an event banner, (1) first place medal, and (1) BIS Patch. Additional banners are not available for purchase.

### UTE Chapter Awards​

High Point Chapter Awards are broken down into 3 divisions for Middle Schools and 4 divisions for High Schools. These divisions are based upon the number of entries from the Texas TSA Rulebook in the UTE categories that each school enters at the State Contest. First, Second, & Third place trophies are awarded to the highest placing Chapters based upon the total of points earned for all of a Chapter’s 1st Place, 2nd Place, 3rd Place, 4th Place, & 5th Place entries. NQE event entries are not included in the entry count or points for the UTE Chapter Awards.

:::info New

New in 2025, a project must earn a minimum of 70% of the possible points on their rubric to earn points towards the Chapter Awards. They will receive their individual awards regardless of score. Also, projects that are entered into the Exploratory Events will not count towards the number of entries or total points earned.
