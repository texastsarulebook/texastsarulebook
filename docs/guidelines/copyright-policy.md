# Copyright Policy

All entries must be the original work of the student participant or student team. All ideas, text, images (photos), computer generated, video and/or other), sounds and other media from other sources must be cited, including anything that is from the public domain. References and resources are to be cited using the most current edition of the Modern Language Association, or MLA, style.

If copyrighted material is used, proper written permission must be included. Failure to follow this procedure will automatically result in disqualification of the students (all projects) and may potentially disqualify the entire chapter from the Texas TSA State Competition.
