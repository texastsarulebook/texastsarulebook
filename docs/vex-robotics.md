# Vex Robotics

Texas TSA State Conference will be hosting an INVITATIONAL TSA VEX Robotics Competition (TVRC) and TSA VEX IQ Challenge (TIQC) tournaments. The invitation is coming from state and to earn an invitation teams must:

- **Complete** the robotics registration process by the **12/15/23 deadline**.
- Compete in **at least 1 recognized local tournament** (TSA or REC) and have a recorded Skills score. The top scores in the state will receive an invitation to the tournament. Top 3 from each region will be sent an invitation to compete and any remaining spots will be filled by the remaining teams with the top Skills score. Limit of 2 teams per chapter.  Last day scores will be pulled is 2/15/24
- Provide **at least 1 volunteer** at the state conference to help with the tournament.

Completed registration includes:

- TSA Chapter has completed affiliation process and is in good standing with their region, state, and national TSA organizations.
- Chapter has registered the team on [www.robotevents.com](https://robotevents.com) and has the team has both a VRC or VIQC team number AND a VRCT and VIQCT team number. This must be done every school year as does not roll over from the previous year.  It is 2 team numbers for 1 team of students.  This must be done by 12/15/23.
- Complete the Texas TSA Robotics registration survey [here](https://forms.gle/BMPPoiNewazjd36N7) by 12/15/23.
- Students on the team have been rostered on the National TSA website before registering for the state conference. 

## 2 Ways for teams to earn Skills Scores

- Team competes at an official TSA tournament that is listed on www.robotevents.com and the tournament host submits the results of the tournament to robotevents.com before 2/15/24.
- Team competes in an official VEX IQ and VRC tournament to earn World Skill Standings before 2/15/24. This option requires the chapter to compete in at least 1 VRC/VIQC tournament. Tournaments are hosted all over Texas almost every weekend starting in October and be registered for at robotevents.com. Skills results will be pulled directly from Robot Events.

Teams may compete in multiple tournaments. On 2/15/2024 the highest scores for each team will be pulled to determine who qualifies for a spot at the state conference and invitations will be sent out soon after.

When competing at the local VRC and VIQC tournaments, please remember you are representing Texas TSA. Teams are expected to fully participate in the tournaments (not just the skills portion unless that is an option offered by the tournament). Any complaints from a tournament Event Partner concerning a team’s behavior may result in those skill scores being invalidated.

The state conference tournament will be following the VEX rules for the games **but with a few modifications** to accommodate our space and time constraints. Check the VEX FAQ page for clarifications.

Advisors and contestants should check the Texas TSA VEX FAQ page for any updates and clarifications. Advisors only may contact the VEX team at [vex@texastsa.org](mailto:vex@texastsa.org) with questions concerning the VEX Robotics Contest at the Texas TSA State Contest.
