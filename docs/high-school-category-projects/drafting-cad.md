# Drafting/CAD

Items in this category involve student created projects in which students created projects using traditional drafting or modern computer aided design standards practices, and methods. This category will be divided into two sections: Engineering and Architecture

:::note
Maximum sheet size in this category is 24 x 36 inches. No limit on number of sheets.
:::

The most current version of the American National Standard Institute (ANSI) standards of symbols and conventions will be the standard for judging.

**DC: 1-1 Precision Dimensions:** Entries should include such dimensioning practices as: datum line, tolerances, limits, geometric symbols, reference dimensions and BASIC dimensions, but not limited to these examples.

**DC: 1-2 Development and Intersections:** Each entry must be accompanied with a model. The suggested material is stiff paper fastened with tape or glue. The model may be painted to appear as metal as desired. The model must be attached to the drawing.

**DC: 1-3 Fillets and Rounds:** May be represented only by curved or straight lines on any drawing for clarity.

**DC: 1-4 Aerospace:** Aerospace is defined as anything for an aeronautical purpose or application. This may include actual aircraft or spacecraft, aircraft/spacecraft parts or projects (flight or non-flight) for NASA H.U.N.C.H. (High Schools United with NASA to Create Hardware).

**Free Hand Lettering:** Is to be used except for CADD and INK drawings. All pencil drawings must have free hand lettering except for pre-printed title block.

**Working Drawings:** shall consist of the following: Multi-view drawings with dimensions necessary for manufacture, and other views such as: isometric, sections, exploded views, assembly views, charts, and notes are acceptable.

Pictorials (exploded) can be used as needed for clarity.

Working drawings may include exploded assemblies/ pictorials/ rendering to describe the various elements of the working drawings. The pictorials/ exploded assemblies may be rendered/ shown.

**Multiple Sheets:** Drawing sets should be fastened together along the left edge.

**Pictorial:** Pictorial drawings do not have to be dimensioned.

**Rendering:** Rendering or shading permitted for pictorials and presentations unless otherwise noted.

**Pictorials on working drawings can be shaded and/or rendered.**

Title Block: Title blocks may contain only the following information:

- Student Initials
- Unique Student ID Number
- Classification Number

:::info Please note

No school logos are allowed!

:::

:::tip Please note however

Student created logos that are not associated with a school mascot/logo are allowed.

:::

All drawings except Presentation Drawings must be plain printed. Presentation drawings may be laminated or mounted, as long as the outside dimension of the matting or lamination does not exceed the drawing size by more than 1/2" on any edge. Blank or mylar cover sheets are allowed on presentation drawings.

**The bold face word CADD means CADD only. All work must be done in CADD. Note: All manual drawings can be either pencil or ink.**
