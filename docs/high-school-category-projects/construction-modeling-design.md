# Construction, Modeling and Design

Items in this category involve projects in which students created and designed structures, models, used commercial kits, or highlighted the design process. Judging criteria for production will be based on the following areas: degree of difficulty, appearance, finish, and craftsmanship. Material used is calculated as item as displayed.

- Maximum base size for models: 30" x 42" (unless otherwise stated)
- Model must have hard copy of plan view (A bird's eye view of the ground floor)

## Study Model

A study model is similar to the type used by architects for site design and planning. Suggested materials: cardboard, foam board, Styrofoam, paper, plastic, balsa wood, and glue. This model is to be unfinished, no landscaping or finishing methods allowed (only structure and typography). All study models are a maximum of 24"x36" unless otherwise specified.

## Interior Design

Projects will be judged on the basis of design: function, color, texture, balance, etc. on a maximum 24" x 36" board. The project should be accompanied by data that has ( 1) complete floor plan set, (2) furniture placement, (3) color palate samples, (4) finish sample board. A design **must be** entirely the original work of the student.
