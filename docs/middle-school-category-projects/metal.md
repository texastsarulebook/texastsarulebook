Items in this category involve student created projects in which students used traditional and modern metal trade tools, methods, and techniques to create projects. Any projects in which CNC mills, lathers, computer controlled lasers, etc. were used to produce any components should not be entered in this category. Purchased materials such as glass, mirrors, and hardware must be listed in documentation and do not count as an additional construction material.

Judging criteria for production will be based on the following areas: degree of difficulty, appearance, finish, and craftsmanship.
