# Recycled Materials

Items made out of a minimum of 50% recycled materials. A recycled material is defined by using an component or material in a way that it was not originally designed for. An example would be using a bathroom tissue rolls to create the inner structure of a foot stool. An example of what is NOT a recycled material is using license plates to create the outline of Texas. A work history must accompany the entry showing the recycled item before construction. Photos documenting the construction process must be included in the required documentation for projects in these categories.
