# Foundry

Projects in this category follow the traditional Foundry Process of heating metal to a liquid state, creating a form/mold, pouring the metal into the form/mold, cooling, and then leaving as a rough cast or finishing it to a final casting. Example projects include but not limited to pendents, mechanical parts, component bodies, and decorative statues.
