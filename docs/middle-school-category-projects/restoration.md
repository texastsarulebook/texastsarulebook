# Restoration

Items that were originally commercially manufactured and have been restored to their original state. A work history must accompany the entry showing the condition of the item before the restoration. All parts not reconditioned by the student must be identified. Photos documenting the restoration process must be included in the required documentation for projects in these categories.
