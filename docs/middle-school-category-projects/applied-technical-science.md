# Applied Technical Science

Displays/Portfolios: The use of photographs, videos, maps, charts, schedules, safety information and other media is encouraged to communicate the message of the entry. The minimum documentation requirement must be an integral part of the display/portfolio.

Entries must be complete and in safe operating condition. All devices and products must be displayed, where feasible, in such a manner as to allow internal inspection of workmanship. High voltage components and potentially dangerous areas must be covered and labeled.
