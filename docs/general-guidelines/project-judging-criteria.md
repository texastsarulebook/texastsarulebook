# Project Judging Criteria

-Judging will be based on the criteria set forth in this rulebook. Projects will be judged using a competition rubric. The scores from the rubric will used to compare all other projects entered in that particular classification number. The primary goal for judges is to score all of the projects in a category number. Tie breaks will be done using a set order of the sections of the rubric.

- The most qualified judges available will be responsible for judging. To avoid a conflict of interest, Texas TSA judges cannot judge areas directly related to their school. The awards and decisions of the Judging/Oversight Committee are final.
- Only those individuals authorized by the Contest Director are allowed in the display area after judging begins. Violation of the display or competitive event competition may result in forfeiture of awards by the school, student, chapter, or entry involved or other action determined by the Contest Management Team.
- To be considered for the Best in State (BIS) patch, the individual entries must be awarded the first place award for their classification. BIS patches are not automatically given but must be purchased at the designated time.
- Documentation must be computer generated on the required forms. Sketches are allowed on otherwise computer generated forms. Documentation is required for all entries. Deductions can only be applied for lack of content, quality of writing, neatness, completeness of drawings, etc. unless otherwise noted.
  Judges should read the introduction section for each category to determine the specific documentation
  requirements for the projects in that area.
- High school advisors cannot be used to judge high school projects and the same will criteria will hold true for middle school advisors. Only with the permission of the Contest Director, will Event Coordinators be allowed to violate this rule.
- The same entry cannot be used in multiple classifications. Further clarification will be provided under each
