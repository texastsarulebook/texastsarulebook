# Hot Rod CO2 Car Competition

Hot Rod Competition (HRC) provides technology students with another opportunity to use their knowledge and skills in problem solving and the fun and excitement of racing competition. The goal of HRC is to encourage students to design and build realistic looking one-fourth mile hot rod car models. The project has been carefully planned to allow students to create realistic scale models of dragsters, funny cars, pro-stock cars and trucks and still have a chance to win races. The vehicle should be built of several parts or sub-assemblies rather than carved out or 3D printed as a single unit.

Student will provide an Engineering Portfolio that will be submitted in a three brad folder (no binders allowed). The Engineering Portfolio must include:

- Cover page with Student ID#, Category #, and Category Name.
- Table of Contents
- Research on the yearly theme
- Detailed design drawings to scale, no larger than 11" X 17", of all of the parts, subassemblies or final car with appropriate dimensions.
