# State Contest Fees

After qualifying through a Texas TSA regional contest, students are eligible to participate and compete in the Texas TSA State Contest, held in Fort Worth. Dates for the event will be posted on the Texas TSA homepage or events page.

Texas TSA does not refund any money for unused state entries. Texas TSA does not require a student to be present at State Contest to enter their project(s), unless they are competing in an event that requires the student to be physically present for the event. Those events include National Qualifying Events and Unique to Texas written tests or graphic Solutions, and most TSA Onsite Events.
