Texas TSA Power and Electric has developed NEW smart electrical meters for the city! These smart meters can be read wirelessly by a drone and then transmitted back to headquarters to determine usage amounts. We need your drone teams to collect this data from across our city and transmit it back to Texas TSA Power and Electricâ€™s headquarters as quickly as possible!
