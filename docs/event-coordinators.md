# Event Coordinators

## Unique to Texas Events (Onsite, Projects, and V5RC & VIQRC Robotics)

Each Event Coordinator, after consultation with the UTE On-Site Manager, is responsible for the operation of the area assigned and has complete control and authority concerning that event. Questions of eligibility are the responsibility of the State Advisor. Concerns/Protests regarding an event must be directed to the UTE On-Site Manager at the time of the event.

## National Qualifing Events

The Event Coordinator works under the guidance of the NQE Managers appointed by Texas TSA. If modifications are needed to the structure or rules of the event those have been approved by the NQE
